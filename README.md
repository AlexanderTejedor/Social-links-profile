## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One of the greatest lessons I have learned from this challenge is the use of variables. I had used variables in CSS some time ago, but working on this project allowed me to practice more, and I feel that it yielded a very good result.

```css
:root{
    /*Colors*/
    --primary-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    --neutral-white:hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --neutral-grey: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    --neutral-drak-grey: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    --neutral-off-black: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
    /*Typography*/
    --paragrapg-size: 14px;
    --normal-weight: 400;
    --medium-weight: 600;
    --bold-weight: 700;
}
```

### Continued development

For future projects, I would like to continue applying CSS variables. I would also like to strengthen my JavaScript skills. I didn't use it here, but with effort, I will be able to implement it in future challenges.
